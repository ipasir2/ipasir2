/**
 * @brief Sets a callback to notify about changes in the current partial assignment under analysis.
 * @details The solver calls this function periodically while being in SOLVING state.
 *          Changes are returned for all variables that have been assigned or unassigned since the last call to the callback.
 *          The solver must ensure that variables in \p assigned and \p unassigned are non-intersecting.
 *          This rule has implication on the minimum frequency of calls to the \p callback.
 *          All assignments must be reported to the callback before the solver switches to a different state.
 *          In particular, the solver must ensure that all assignments are reported before leaving SOLVING state.
 *          Subsequent calls to ipasir2_set_notify() override the previously set callback function.
 *          Setting the callback function to nullptr disables the callback.
 *          \p callback is called with the same value for parameter \p data as the one passed to ipasir2_set_notify().
 * 
 * @param solver The solver instance.
 * @param data Opaque pointer passed to the callback function as the first parameter.
 * @param callback The notify callback function of the form "void callback(void* data, int32_t const* assigned, int32_t const* unassigned)".
 * 
 * @return IPASIR2_E_OK if the function call was successful.
 *         IPASIR2_E_UNSUPPORTED if the solver does not support notify callbacks.
 * 
 * Required state: <= SOLVING
 * State after: same as before
