 * IPASIR-2: The Re-entrant Incremental SAT Solver API (IPASIR) Version 2.0
 *
 * This header specifies the API for incremental SAT solvers.
 *
 *
 * Terminology
 * -----------
 *
 * In IPASIR2, solver instances are represented by opaque pointers obtained from
 * ipasir2_init().
 *
 *
 * Thread Safety
 * -------------
 *
 * IPASIR2 allows using multiple solvers in parallel. The intention is to cover use
 * cases where the client starts an arbitrary number of solver instances in
 * parallel, but interacts with each individual solver instance only sequentially.
 * For example, it is legal to add clauses to two different solver instances in
 * parallel, but executing ipasir2_add() in parallel on the same solver instance
 * is illegal.
 *
 * ipasir2_init() and ipasir2_signature() have no restrictions regarding multithreading.
 *
 * All other IPASIR2 functions take a solver instance S as an argument. Clients may not
 * access S through these functions concurrently. When S invokes a callback function,
 * the client may access S from that callback only from the caller's thread.
 *
 * Solver instances may call callback functions only during ipasir2_solve(), and only
 * from the same thread where the client had called ipasir2_solve(). This serves
 * to keep client code simple and to avoid compatibility issues, for example when
 * IPASIR2 is used in scripting languages.
 *
 * IPASIR2 implementations may offer custom options to replace these thread-safety
 * requirements.

/**
 * @brief Sets a callback to notify about fixed assignments.
 * @details The solver calls this function while being in SOLVING state.
 *         Whenever a solver determines that a variable is fixed to a certain value, it calls this function.
 *         The function does not return the fixed literals in any particular order, nor does it guarantee that all fixed literals are reported.
 *         All literals reported are guaranteed to be in the backbone of the formula, i.e., they are true in all models of the formula.
 *
 * @param[in] solver The solver instance.
 * @param[in] data Opaque pointer passed to the callback function as the first parameter. May be nullptr.
 * @param[in] callback The notify callback function with the same signature as "void callback(void* data, int32_t fixed)".
 *                     If this parameter is nullptr, this callback mechanism is disabled.
 *
 * @return IPASIR2_E_OK if the function call was successful.
 *         IPASIR2_E_UNSUPPORTED if the solver does not support fixed assignment callbacks.
 * 
 * Required state of \p solver: <= SOLVING
 * State of \p solver after the function returns: same as before
