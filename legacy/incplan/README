This benchmark solves planning problems incrementally. Each instance of a
planning problem can be described as:

- initial clauses I: satisfied in the initial statet t[0]
- goal clauses G: satisfied in the goal state t[i]
- universal clauses U: satisfied at every time point t[k]
- transition clauses T : satisfied at each pair of consecutive time point t[k],
t[k+1]

The instances have been generated from a subset of the benchmarks of the
Planning Competition (IPC) 2014 with help of a modified version of the planner
madagascar [1,3].

The problems are encoded using the double ended incremental encoding. Details
can be found in [2].



The software is available via GitHub [4].
