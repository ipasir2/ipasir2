1) Viewing the benchmark results
To view the benchmark results you need jupyter notebook. The resultAnalysis.ipynb file contains all scripts used to evaluate the colleted result data icaps17-benchmark.txt.

2) Reproduce the experiments from the icaps 2017 paper

To reproduce the experiment make sure to check out commit f951c76b5cf97bf96.

2.1) Planning Tools
2.1.1) Madgascar
Get madagascar from https://users.ics.aalto.fi/rintanen/satplan.html the February 25, 2015 version of the source code was used.

Apply the patch provided (./madagascarPatch.diff) and compile madagascar. Then move MpC to the bin directory of this repository.

2.1.2) Freelunch
Is already provided in this repository. (bin/srt.jar)

2.2) Sat solver
Get the incremental sat solvers from the 2016 SAT competition:
http://baldur.iti.kit.edu/sat-competition-2016/downloads/incremental.zip

compile the cominisatps2sun_nopre solver and copy libipasircominisatps2sun_nopre.a to lib/ipasir/

now compile incplan:
cd incplan/build
make

2.3) Planning Domains
Get the planning problems zip files from the 2014 IPC:
https://helios.hud.ac.uk/scommv/IPC-14/repository/benchmarksV1.1.zip

2.4) Running the Benchmarks
Run:
experiment/icaps17/runExperiment [pathToPlanningZip]
experiment/icaps17/collectData

You should now have a collectedData.txt, which can be analyzed with the jupyter notebook (see 1)
